MTD is the second of two open-source tools that allow language communities and developers to quickly and inexpensively make their dictionary data digitally accessible. MTD-UI is a tool that visualizes dictionary data that is prepared with [MTD](https://github.com/roedoejet/mothertongues).

Please visit the [website](https://www.mothertongues.org) or [docs](https://mother-tongues-dictionaries.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information.

## Background

This is a basic [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) app for displaying Mother Tongues Dictionaries data. Other frontends are in development.

**Note** - Just because you _can_ make an online dictionary does _not_ mean you _should_. Before making a dictionary, you must have clear consent from the language community in order to publish a dictionary. For some background on why this is important, please read sections 1 and 2.1 [here](http://oxfordre.com/linguistics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.001.0001/acrefore-9780199384655-e-8)

## Usage

In order to use MTD-UI you must have a generated language configuration file and generated dictionary data from [MTD](https://github.com/roedoejet/mothertongues).
Then, either fork or clone this repo and put those files in either the `www/assets/js/` folder right away or in `src/assets/js/` in order to build the app from source.

## Contributing

PRs accepted. If you would like to create more MTD-UIs those are also accepted.

## Acknowledgements

MTD-UI has had significant help from a huge number of people including but not limited to Patrick Littell, Mark Turin, & Lisa Matthewson.
